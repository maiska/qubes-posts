The Qubes OS Project is seeking an expert in automated testing. We use
OpenQA and GitLab CI to test changes to the Qubes OS source code and
automated building from source. We're looking for someone who can help
with improving both the automated tests themselves and the testing
infrastructure.

This is a paid position on a six-month part-time contract with a
budgeted rate of $30-50 USD per hour through the Internews BASICS
project (Building Analytical and Support Infrastructure for Critical
Security tools):
